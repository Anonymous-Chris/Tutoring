CODE DOCUMENTATION
This project is made using React JS, CSS, for front end and Node JS, Express JS for backend of the website. For database, firebase is being used. To edit or change this project in future requires some or more knowledge of these languages. I have made this project in visual studio code. Before proceeding further, Node JS has to be installed first. And  below is the rest of the documentation:

The entire code of the project can be found in the following link:
Github: https://github.com/Anonymous-Chris/Full-final

The build version which is the entire project that can be easily embedded in other hosting parties such as Heroku can be found in:
Github: https://github.com/Anonymous-Chris/Tutoring

Or, we could also get the build version by running npm run build after we install all the modules and dependencies as described below:
To compile the project in the local host, you need to follow few of these steps:

Step 1:  Download the entire code to a folder in the computer.

Step 2:  Open the entire folder in Visual Studio Code.

Step 3: If NodeJS has been installed then proceed to step 4 else install NodeJS and then proceed to step 4.

Step 4:  Now type npm install in command line of visual studio code

Step 5:  After step 4 is completed, run cd frontend
	And type npm install
	
Step 6:  After completion of step 5, cd src 
	And type npm install  
	
Step 7:  run cd .. and run cd.. from command line to go back to the main folder

Step 8:  Finally type npm run dev from command line which starts the server and the website

So, this basically starts the website and you can start editing other files and see changes in the User Interface to find the difference and change as needed in the future.
